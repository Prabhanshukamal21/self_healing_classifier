# self_healing_classifier
A self-healing sentiment classifier using a fine-tuned DistilBERT model with LangGraph. It ensures reliable predictions by using fallback logic when confidence is low.         How can I improve fallback accuracy?  Show me example inputs and outputs.  Explain LangGraph's role here.
